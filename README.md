# Marble3D_Project_FIles
Project files for the 3D marble game Godot project

Hello and thank you for checking out this project! I have split all the tutorials into seperate branches for your use. Once the entire project is done, the plan is to merge it all into the main
repo, so be on the lookout for that.

if you try making your own game with this, I would appreciate a shoutout, but it is not necessary :)
